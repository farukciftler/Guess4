Guess4

Guess4 is a number guessing game where players try to guess a 4-digit number generated by the computer. The game involves making a series of guesses, and the computer provides feedback in the form of plus and minus signs to indicate how close each guess is to the generated number.

How to Play

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:4500 to access the game.
Enter a unique room ID to start a new game, or enter an existing room ID to join a game that is already in progress.
Make your first guess by entering a 4-digit number with no repeated digits in the input field and clicking the "Guess" button.
The computer will provide feedback in the form of plus and minus signs. A plus sign (+) means that a digit in your guess is in the correct position, while a minus sign (-) means that a digit in your guess is in the generated number but in the wrong position.
Keep making guesses until you correctly guess the 4-digit number.
If you correctly guess the number, you win! Otherwise, keep guessing until you reach the maximum number of guesses allowed.
Once the game is over, you can start a new game by entering a new room ID.
